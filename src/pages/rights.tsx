                    1. Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.

                In the world we live in today, articles 23.1, 23.2, and 23.4 are being
                broken in workplaces anywhere. 23.4 is broken by union busters and scabs,
                punishing people for even wanting to join a union.
            </p>
            <p>
                23.1 Is broken because of the strictly unfavourable conditions of many
                people's work; it is not 'favourable' to be paid less than a living
                wage for a full-time job.
            </p>
            <p className="inverted">
                23.2 is broken because of discrimination in pay for various things,
                race, gender, anything! The ones managing the salaries might
                not even be aware that they're being prejudicious.

                These articles are essential to make sure that workplaces
                around the world function properly and adequately compensate
                whatever labor goes into them. Without them, bosses get to
                be as greedy as they would like to, and unfortunately,
                that is 'rob you blind' greedy.
