      <p style={{fontSize: '20px', marginBottom: 0}}>
        Hi!
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm Rian Doty, the founder of Labor Unions For All.
      </p>

        Now that COVID-19 is on the back foot and society can get back
        to not turning inside-out again, it seemed to me like the astronomical
        pricing of basic needs would, you know, chill. But seeing as that
        doesn't seem to be happening anytime soon enough for many people,
        I was moved to make this information campaign!
      </p>
      <p>
        Being a member of <b>GENERATION Z,</b> our outlook isn't exactly
        the best. Global warming threatens to blow up the planet, a world war
        that just might go nuclear is constantly given the opportunity to erupt,
        and getting a good, well-paying job that can support your needs,
        not even to live, but to <b>survive,</b> seems <i>impossible.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        We need to be educated and knowledgable about just how useful,
        and in the most dire cases <i>necessary,</i> unions are to not
        just the health of our wallets, but ourselves.
      </p>
